# Nitrox-Anti-Piracy-Bypass
This is a bypass for the anti-piracy detection in the official Nitrox multiplayer support software for Subnautica, by modifying the NitroxModel file only. 

# Guide
Install the official Nitrox app from https://nitrox.rux.gg/, then once installed, navigate to the lib folder in the main directory, and extract this zip file in that location, replacing two existing files.
Then, run the Nitrox.exe in Administrator mode. 
You're finished!
